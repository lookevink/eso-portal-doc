## Seller Appointment Details Form

When the appointment type is for a seller, the row in Appointment Data Table will click through to here, where you can manage appointment details and track appointment outcome. The fields are self explanatory. We will update the `Outcome` and `Outcome Notes` fields after the appointment is completed.
