## My Lead Data Table

This screen helps you manage your assigned leads. You can search, sort, and filter for leads. You can also click through to the lead details screen and edit the lead. Here's a basic view of the data table:

### Searching

The search bar at the top left of the data table lets you search through leads' names, emails, and phone numbers. The search is case-insensitive and will match partial words. For example, searching for "john" will match "John Smith."

To use it, simply type in the search bar and the table will update automatically.

### Filtering

You can filter leads by their type (buyer or seller) and status.

The same operations can be performed for other data categories.

### Sorting

You can sort each column whose header has a pair of up & down arrows. Clicking the header toggles that column's sort order between ascending and descending. The table will update automatically.
