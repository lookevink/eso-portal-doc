## Add a lead

Clicking the `Add Lead` button at the top right of the data table will direct you to the add lead form. The fields are self-explanatory. You can check against existing owner records by searching through our directory of phone numbers under the `Existing Owner Check` field.
For security reason, we are throttling the search function. You can submit your lead without duplicate check, and we will run the dedupe for you on our server.
